# Dining Review RESTful API

This project is a RESTful web API that provides endpoints for submitting and querying dining reviews.

## Spring API Project

This project is a demonstration of building a RESTful web API with data persistence using Spring and Spring Data JPA. 
The goal of this project is to showcase my skills, 
while also having an opportunity to learn and research new techniques.

## Project Objectives

- The dining review consists of a unique display name, a restaurant ID, and optional scores for peanut, egg, and dairy allergies, and an optional commentary.
- The API enables creating, updating, and querying dining reviews using HTTP methods such as POST, PUT, GET, and DELETE.
- The project uses Spring and Spring Data JPA for data persistence and H2 embedded database.
- Additionally, Lombok annotations are applied to simplify the code.
- This project provides a solid foundation for building more complex dining review applications with additional features and functionalities.
